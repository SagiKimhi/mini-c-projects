The task is to construct a tower in N days.

The number N is be given as the first line of input as a single int

disks with larger sizes are placed at the bottom of the tower.
disks with smaller sizes are placed on top.
disk sizes go from (1,2,3...N-1,N)

the int at the ith day denotes the size of the disks that are given
on the ith day - if 4 was given on day 1, 5 will be given on day 2.
which means the first integer x will determine the next max which 
would be x-1. and once x-1 is found it can be placed on the bottom.


Pseudo code:
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	scan a single int from the first line of input - save it as N.
	set max to N.
	for (int day=0; day<N; day++) {
		scan a single integer.
		if (int == max)
			max = rear-1.
		
		

	}
}
